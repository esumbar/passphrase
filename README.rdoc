= passphrase

Trying to come up with a good passphrase when creating an SSH public key pair
or when signing up for an online service is a pain. Typical password generators
yield a string of random characters which may be strong but is often hard to
type. The {Diceware method}[http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html]
constructs a passphrase made up of more-or-less recognizable words. This makes
it easier to type, while still being reasonably secure. Passphrase is a command
line tool written in Ruby for generating a passphrase using the Diceware
method.

The act of rolling dice is simulated by requesting random numbers from
{www.random.org}[http://www.random.org]. If a network error occurs or a request
fails, the program gracefully degenerates to using SecureRandom::random_number.

Words in the generated passphrase are selected from either the Diceware list or
the alternate list edited by Alan Beale, referred to as the _Beale_ list.  The
choice of list for each word is made randomly. Both lists are embedded into the
code as compressed, base64 encoded strings. No external files are referenced.

== Generating a passphrase

The command line interface is simple. You have the option to request from 3 to
10 words in the generated passphrase. The default is 5 if a number is not
specified. In addition, at least one capital letter, one number character, and
one non-alphanumeric character are automatically mixed into the passphrase.
However, you can omit mixing if desired.

  Usage: passphrase [options]
  Options:
    -n, --num-words NUMBER           Desired number of words (3..10), default 5
    -x, --[no-]mix                   Mix in cap, num, non-alphanum, default mix
    -l, --local                      Forcefully use the local random number generator
    -h, --help                       Show this message and exit
    -v, --version                    Show version and exit

== Examples

  $ passphrase --num-words 3
  unmixed phrase => tomb sima smog
  passphrase     => ]omb s0ma smoG

  $ passphrase --num-words 4 --no-mix
  passphrase => humus smooth persia mz

If you don't like a generated passphrase, repeat the command.

== Contributing to passphrase
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
